### About
Calcucoach is a free web app that generates workouts customized for you. 
We love living healthy lifestyles and we wanted to make it super easy for
anybody to do the same. We were inspired to develop this app after being
quarantined for so long during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope you enjoy and
happy working out!
